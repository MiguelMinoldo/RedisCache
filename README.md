# RedisCache
Azure Cache for Redis is a fully managed, distributed, in-memory cache that enables high-performance and scalable architectures. You can use it to create cloud or hybrid deployments that handle millions of requests per second at sub-millisecond latency, all with the configuration, security and availability benefits of a managed service.
